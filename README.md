<!--Before-->
Tasked with recreating the google homepage. Need to use HTML and CSS skills learned to make my version as close (visually) to the real google homepage. 
<!--After-->
Finished the project and got it to look very close to the original google homepage. Learned how to create a navigation bar and footer. Successfully linked the appropriate webpages to each heading. Was able to learn how to use the :hover tag and used it to style a number of things. Also learned one functionality of the js event "onclick". Used this on the two buttons under the search bar. Some things that I weren't able to do were add the dropdown feature to the item next to "sign in" and make the search bar functional. The inspect tool was very useful in locating specific colors and spacing. Also used the inspect tool to tweak things right from the page without having to go back to my text editor.
